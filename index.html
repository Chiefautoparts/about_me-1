      <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Bret Ladenburg and i'm extremely pleased to be sharing my life story with you!  I love computers, electronics and using them to interact with people all over the world in all sorts of new ways.  I was born and raised in Seattle, WA which is actually a blessing in disguise because not only do I love the mountains, but I love the rain as well.  I hope that looking over this website you will get the chance to learn a little bit more about me!</p>
